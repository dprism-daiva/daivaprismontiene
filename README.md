Hi there 👋, I'm Daiva!

A wise person once said, 'Don't be afraid to start over again.This time, you’re not starting from scratch, you’re starting from experience.' Returning to study after a break has proven to be especially rewarding🏆. I realize that I’m not pursuing this education solely for the results, but out of a deep commitment and determination.

I completed my Data Analytics studies at Turing College, which has equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge to shift my career path and explore new fields🚀. I began my journey in Business Data Analytics at Retal Lithuania. 
My progression through various roles has made me a strong, motivated, and results-oriented professional. This experience has taught me team building and motivation, broadened my perspective, and encouraged creative problem-solving. For a detailed overview of my professional background, you can refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daiva-prismontiene/).

Currently, I am seeking a position that will allow me to deepen my expertise in SQL, database management, and Power BI (or other visualization tool), applying my skills to real business challenges and hands-on experience.
I am able to communicate clearly in both spoken and written Lithuanian and English. I am energetic, organized, and responsible.In my work I am patient and bring my own perspective andapproach. I am focused, attentive to detail, and fully committed toproducing high-quality work.
